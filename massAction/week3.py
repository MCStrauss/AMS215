A DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION is a relation between a function and its
derivatives.

Differential equations form the language in which the basic laws of
science are expressed. The science tells us how the system at hand
changes "from one instant to the next." The challenge addressed by the
theory of differential equations is to take this short-term
information and obtain information about long-term overall behavior.
So the art and practice of differential equations involves the following
sequence of steps: one "models" a system (physical, chemical, biological,
economic, or even mathematical) by means of a differential equation;
one then attempts to gain information about solutions of this equation;
and one then translates this mathematical information back into the
scientific context.
